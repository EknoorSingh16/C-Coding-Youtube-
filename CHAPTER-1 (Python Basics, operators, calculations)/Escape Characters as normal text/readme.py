"""
Escape Characters can be used/printed as a normal txt using doublebackslash
The DoubleBackslash is treated as a single backslash and the txt after that is printed as a normal txt
"""

# For example:
print("Line A\nLine B\nLine C")
#this code is written with escape characters and we do not get the desired output

# now see the examples.py to see how escape characters are printed
