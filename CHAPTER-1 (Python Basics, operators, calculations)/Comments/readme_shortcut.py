#Similarly if we want to make comments on a line, we can also use VSCODE shortcuts -->
#This can be done on any line and that line is already written or not, it does not matter
#This is much more efficent when you have already written a code and forgot or want to comment it later
#The shortcut is: 'ctrl + forward slash'
#When this shortcut is used that line will be converted to a comment or we can say a comment is generated
#It doesnt matter if u use the shortcut before or after the code or even between the code, u just have to keep the cursor on the line you want to comment and that line will be commented


#For example:
# print("This is a example of comment")

# print("Example while commenting while cursor in between")

# NOTE: we can uncomment the line we want to by using the same shortcut and same principles\examples applies to it as well.

# For example:
print("Here the comment is removed")
