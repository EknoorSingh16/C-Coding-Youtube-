#A Comment is for user only.
#i.e the python interepter will ignore it and anything written inside it will be ignored
#it ignores it as it is not a part of the required code

#We make comments by using '#' 
#we can make as many comments as we want and there are no restriction

#FOR EXAMPLE:
#everything written above is a commment 

#EXAMPLE 2:
print("Eknoor Singh") #this is a print function used to print anything

#EXAMPLE 3:
print("line A\nLine B\nLine C") #\n is used for new line 

#EXAMPLE 3:
print("name:\tEknoor\tSingh") 
#\t is used for tab

#SIMILARLY WE CAN DO COMMENTS IN ANY CODE WE WANT AND AS MUCH AS WE WANT
